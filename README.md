## Introduction

Malware means malicious software. They affect our system in various ways. There are many malwares that can steal the data on any computer, can block the access to one’s system, can gain the whole access to one’s system. Hence, they can cause serious harm to the victim. They mainly spread through internet. There are many types of malwares like viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, ransomware etc.

This project includes detailed study and implementation of three malwares:
1. Ransomware
2. Leakware
3. Scareware

### 1. Ransomware:

This study shows the implementation of file-encrypting ransomware also known as cryptoviral extortion. Here all the files of victim’s system are encrypted by a symmetric key and that symmetric key is encrypted by a public key. Hence, the encrypted symmetric key can be decrypted using the private key of attacker and then the decrypted 
symmetric key will be used to decrypt the encrypted files.

### 2. Leakware:

Leakware is a type of ransomware, but it doesn’t block access to victim’s system or encrypts the data. It rather steals all to data from victim’s system and then threatens the victim to leak all data if a ransom is not paid. 

### 3. Scareware:

Scareware is a type of malware that makes the victim believe that there is a virus in his system. There is no such real virus in the system, but through some pop-ups or ads, the victim comes under the impression that his system has a virus. Such malwares are used so that victim downloads any additional software. Antivirus companies use this technique so that the victim buy their antivirus.
